## Curriculum

###  1. Introduction to Data Analysis
In this introductory lesson, we learn how data is being applied to many industries. We work on a project (Ex-LinkedIn Top Skills) that will help us draw insights from interactive dashboards. Our objective is to interpret these data visualisations and explain these insights to others.

We later learn, the applications of spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets and how we can manipulate, anlalyse and visualise data using these tools. We are also introduced to differences between descriptive and inferential statistics along with some business metrics that are used in the areas of marketing, sales, growth and finance. Finally, we learn how to forecast sales and financial models using tools like Scenario Analysis.

#### Project - Analyse NYSE Data
In this project, we use NYSE dataset that contains financial data for Fortune 500 companies We analyse this dataset and design a dashboard that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income statement for each company using data validation and advanced lookup tools within Excel. We forecast these metrics within the income statement, based on three scenarios with distinct assumptions.

### 2. SQL for Data Analysis 
In this lesson, we learn how to install SQL (Structured Query Language) on our machines, create and update databases, ask complex questions and query databases to answer them. We begin with basic syntax and later dive into joins, aggregations. We conclude with few advanced concepts like using sub-queries and window functions.

#### Project - Query Digital Music Store Database
In this project, we query a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. We use the database to help the store gain an understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices

### 3. Data Visualisation
In this last lesson, we learn how to share our insights by building interactive dashboards in Tableau and learn how to narrate stories using them. We are introduced to key data visualisation principles like design integrity and chart junk and later proceed to build visulisations. We also learn some useful features like filters, hierarchies, group sets and calculated fields. We conclude by learning how to convey impactful stories. 

#### Project - Build Data Dashboards
In this project, we build interactive dashboards with Tableau to tell stories from data. We use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more. Upon completion of this project, we are able to evaluate effectiveness of a data visualisation and build engaging Tableau dashboards.
